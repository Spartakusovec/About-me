# About me ‚≠ê

Basically just a portfolio of projects I did. Mostly just data science because that's what I like. 

I didn"t really stop programming, I just focused more on python in general, so I did these two projects.

## Data Analyze üìä

### First project - [EDA_Titanic](https://github.com/Spartakusovec/About-me/blob/main/EDA_titanic.py)
After some time I realized that I kinda miss doing data science, I forgot many things and I wanted to refresh my memory and get used to working in python and its libraries. Doing this project was fun and I liked it, maybe I made some mistakes in code, but that wasn't that important to me now. Like I said I just wanted to refresh what I used to have in head and this project was good enough for it, so from now on it'll only get better.

### Second project - [Pandas](https://github.com/Spartakusovec/About-me/blob/main/pandas_project.py)
Probably even easier project, again I refreshed some basics with pandas. I had to deal with missing values, replacing them with mean value or most occuring value, nothing hard, but its good to know.

### Third project - [Matplotlib](https://github.com/Spartakusovec/About-me/blob/main/matplotlip_project.py)
I wanted to practice visualizing data, so I did this project. I hope that I'll start doing something more complex soon, cause this was fairly easy. But still I enjoyed it.

Here I checked if there's positive correlation between physicians and hospital beds.

### Fourth project - [Plotly pie and dash](https://github.com/Spartakusovec/About-me/blob/main/plotly_pie.py) 
This time I used plotly to visualize data, have to say that working with it was quite intuitive and easy to understand. I also tried working with dash, I didn't create any project in it, but I learned something new. I'll definetly look bit more into it. 

![Pie plot](https://github.com/Spartakusovec/About-me/assets/65900163/90ebf8a9-9229-482a-b745-becc9be2e520)

Example of how can plot in plotly look like.

But right now I think I'm ready to try real data science and not just data analyzing.

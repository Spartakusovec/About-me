# About me

Basicaly just a portfolio of projects I did. Mostly just data science because that's what I like. 

### First project - [EDA_Titanic](https://github.com/Spartakusovec/About-me/blob/main/EDA_titanic.py)
After some time I realizde that I kinda miss doing data science, I forgot many things and I wanted to refresh my memory and get used to working in python and its libraries. Doing this project was fun and I liked it, maybe I made some mistakes in code, but that wasn't that important to me now. Like I said I just wanted to refresh what I used to have in head and this porject was good enough for it, so from now on it'll only get better.

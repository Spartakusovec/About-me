# About me

Basically just a portfolio of projects I did. Mostly just data science because that's what I like. 

### First project - [EDA_Titanic](https://github.com/Spartakusovec/About-me/blob/main/EDA_titanic.py)
After some time I realized that I kinda miss doing data science, I forgot many things and I wanted to refresh my memory and get used to working in python and its libraries. Doing this project was fun and I liked it, maybe I made some mistakes in code, but that wasn't that important to me now. Like I said I just wanted to refresh what I used to have in head and this project was good enough for it, so from now on it'll only get better.

### Second project - [Pandas](https://github.com/Spartakusovec/About-me/blob/main/pandas_project.py)
Probably even easier project, again I refreshed some basics with pandas. I had to deal with missing values, replacing them with mean value or most occuring value, nothing hard, but its good to know.

### Third project - [Matplotlib](https://github.com/Spartakusovec/About-me/blob/main/matplotlip_project.py)
I wanted to practice visualizing data, so I did this project. I hope that I'll start doing something more complex soon, cause this was fairly easy. But still I enjoyed it.
